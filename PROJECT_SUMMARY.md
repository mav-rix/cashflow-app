## 🚀 How to Run the App

### Prerequisites
⚠️ **Important**: You need Node.js 20+ (currently have Node.js 18)

### Quick Start (After Node.js Upgrade)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/eric/Projects/cashflow

# Run setup script
./setup.sh

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser
# http://localhost:3000
```

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Setup database
npx prisma db push
npm run db:seed

# Start server
npm run dev
```

## ⚙️ Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run db:push      # Push database schema
npm run db:seed      # Seed database with categories
npm run db:studio    # Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
```

## 🎨 Tech Stack Highlights

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: Prisma + SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Auth**: Custom JWT-based authentication
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **UI**: Custom components with professional design
